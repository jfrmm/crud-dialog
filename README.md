## Getting started

The following instructions are guidelines for a development environment based on Docker.

### Install

Start by downloading and installing dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

#### Build the package

You can now build the filter box package by running:

```shell script
npm run build-lib
```

This outputs the package to `dist/crud-dialog-library`

> Adding the `--watch` flag will make it so that when you make changes to the library, angular-cli will rebuild the package, to make it available to your application.

#### Publish the package

Update your package version on `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `projects/crud-dialog-library/package.json`, create the tag, and then just run

```shell script
npm run publish-lib
```

> You'll have to login first with `npm login`

## Unit Testing

There are unit tests that you can run.

```shell script
ng test crud-dialog-library
```

> See also [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Developing and running this demo app

Follow the development guidelines and standards found in [Angular](https://angular.io).
To run this project in a development environment simply run:

```shell script
ng serve
```

### Library access points

The `public-api.ts` file defines what is available for the consumers. Use a **NgModule** to expose services and components. A consumer of the library should be able to access public functionality through a single import path.

## Contributing

Please follow our contributing guide in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Package generation not working

Sometimes the **angular-cli** will not generate our package when it has been ran a long time ago. usually removing the `dist` folder solves this problem.
